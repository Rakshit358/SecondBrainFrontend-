# Second Brain

Second Brain is a web application that lets you capture, organize, and share your favorite YouTube videos and Twitter threads—all in one place. It’s your digital “second brain” for saving and revisiting your most valuable content. Additionally, Second Brain includes an AI-powered feature that allows you to query an AI assistant using the context stored in your brain.

## Features

* **Save YouTube Videos**: Store links to your favorite videos with custom titles.
* **Save Twitter Threads**: Archive Twitter threads for quick reference.
* **Organize by Collection**: Group content into personalized “brains” or collections.
* **Share Your Brain**: Instantly share any of your collections with friends or colleagues via shareable links.
* **AI-Powered Insights**: Ask questions and get smart responses powered by AI, using the context already stored in your brain. No extra copy-pasting—your brain’s data is automatically provided to the AI.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
* **Data Fetching**: Axios
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express
* **Database**: MongoDB via Mongoose
* **AI Integration**: OpenAI (or your preferred AI provider)

### Prerequisites

* MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)

## Usage

1. **Create a Brain**: Click **Add Content** and choose either YouTube or Twitter.
2. **Enter Title & Link**: Provide a custom title and paste the URL.
3. **View & Manage**: Your saved items appear as cards—edit, delete, or share them.
